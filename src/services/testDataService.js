    "The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization and innovation during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and quickly spread throughout Western Europe and North America, and later throughout much of the world. The development of steam power and the factory system were key drivers of this period.",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.",
    "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas."
